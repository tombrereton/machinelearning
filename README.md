## Synopsis

I am taking the coursera machine learning course. Throughout this course I will committing the assignments to github for my own benefit and anyone else who wishes to look at them. The code is written for MATLAB or Octave.

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

This is a project I will be doing in my spare time outside full time work so I can understand machine learning better.

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contributors

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.

## License

A short snippet describing the license (MIT, Apache, etc.)
